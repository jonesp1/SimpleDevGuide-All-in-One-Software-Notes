## Brainstorm Many Solutions

Encourage creative thinking by:

- Generating a list of potential solutions without judgment.
- Considering different approaches and perspectives.
- Exploring both traditional and innovative solutions.

## Pick the Best Solution

Evaluate and choose the most suitable solution by:

- Considering factors such as simplicity, maintainability, and efficiency.
- Weighing the pros and cons of each solution.
- Seeking input from team members if applicable.

## Make a Good Plan

Create a well-thought-out plan to guide your implementation:

- Break down the problem into smaller tasks.
- Define the order of tasks and dependencies.
- Consider potential challenges and devise solutions.

## Write the Tests (TDD)

Follow the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach:

- Write test cases that represent expected behavior.
- Implement the minimum code necessary to pass the tests.
- Refactor and iterate to improve both code and tests.

## Write the Code

Translate your plan and tests into executable code:

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.
- Follow coding standards and best practices.
- Ensure the code aligns with the outlined plan.

## Refactor

Improve the structure and design of your code without changing its external behavior:

- Identify opportunities for simplification and optimization.
- Enhance code readability and maintainability.
- Address technical debt and potential improvements.

## Optimize

Enhance the performance and efficiency of your solution:

- Analyze the time and space complexity of your code.
- Explore optimization techniques without sacrificing clarity.
- Strive for a balance between performance and maintainability.
