# Linked List Documentation

## Overview

A linked list is a dynamic data structure in programming that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next one. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation.

# When to Use Linked Lists

Linked lists are useful in various situations, and you might consider using them when:

1. **Dynamic Size:** When you need a data structure with a dynamic size that can change during runtime.

2. **Efficient Insertion/Deletion:** Linked lists excel at efficient insertion and deletion operations, especially in the middle of the list, as they only require adjusting pointers.

3. **No Fixed Size:** Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size, making them suitable for scenarios where the size of the collection is unknown or frequently changes.

4. **Memory Efficiency:** Linked lists can be memory-efficient, especially when elements are inserted or removed frequently, as memory allocation is not contiguous.

## Pros of Linked Lists

1. **Dynamic Size:** Linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically based on the application's needs.

2. **Efficient Insertion/Deletion:** Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of a linked list is efficient, as it only requires adjusting pointers.

3. **No Fixed Size:** Linked lists do not have a fixed size, providing flexibility for dynamic applications.

4. **Versatility:** Linked lists support various types of elements within the same list.

## Cons of Linked Lists

1. **Random Access is Inefficient:** Accessing elements in a linked list is less efficient than arrays, as it requires traversing the list from the beginning.

2. **More Memory Overhead:** Linked lists have more memory overhead than arrays due to the additional memory required for storing pointers.

3. **Complexity:** Implementing and managing linked
